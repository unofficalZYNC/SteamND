# SteamND
SteamND searches a local game database to identify a game, then retrieves its metadata and Steam ID by querying official or mimicked Steam API endpoints. It extracts the user's Steam auth token from local files, uses it to add the game to their library via API, and updates the local database to reflect the change.
